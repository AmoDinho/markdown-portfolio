I am a Front End Dev that loves solving problems with design. Primarly I am able to build apps in __Node__ while I am currently learning how to leverage _Serverless_ Architectures to be able to build apps that suited for the cloud. 

I am also a keen Data Scienist, I believe that with the amount of data being generated from humans, Devs will need to be able to add machine learning capabilities in their apps. I prefer using Python for ad hoc _Data Science and **Kaggle** compitions_.
